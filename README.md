# Totoro.css
totoro.css is a scalable, BEM with stateful classes, CSS4 and Sass-based, OOCSS framework (what the heck? ðŸ˜†). Designed to help developers to organise their front-end development architecture. In other words, trying to make it suck less.

## Browser support
totoro.css relies on [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make features compatible with legacy browsers. It also takes advantage of [normalise.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [sass-mq](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq) to compose media queries and global box-sizing.

totoro.css is compatible with recent versions of:
- Safari
- Chrome
- Edge
- Firefox
- Opera
- Internet Explorer 11

## Why totoro.css?
totoro.css leaves a minimal footprint, which means that it does not provide any UI components, instead, think of it as the backbone of your CSS. As it's intention is to provide manageable and pain-free architecture.
